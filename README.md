### Assignment Questions of SQL ###
-- 1. Create a table called employees with the following structure
-- emp_id (integer, should not be NULL and should be a primary key)
-- emp_name (text, should not be NULL)
 -- age (integer, should have a check constraint to ensure the age is at least 18)
 -- email (text, should be unique for each employee)
 -- salary (decimal, with a default value of 30,000).
 -- Write the SQL query to create the above table with all constraints. 
 
 create database assignment;
 use assignment;
 create table employees(emp_id int(10) not null primary key,
 emp_name varchar(50) not null,
 age int(3) check(age >= 18),
 email varchar(60) unique,
 salary decimal(10,2) default 30000);
 
 select * from employees;
 
 -- 2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide 
--  examples of common types of constraints.

-- Ans-  Constraints in SQL are rules applied to table columns that ensure the accuracy and reliability of data within a database. 
#  They help maintain data integrity by enforcing certain conditions on the data,
#  By using constraints, databases ensure that only valid, meaningful, and well-structured data is entered into tables, 
#  which helps in maintaining the quality of the data.

#Examples of Common Types of Constraints-
#1.NOT NULL-Ensures a column cannot have NULL values
#2.UNIQUE-Ensures all values in a column are unique
#3.PRIMARY KEY-Uniquely identifies each row in a table
#4.FOREIGN KEY-Enforces referential integrity between tables
#5.CHECK-Ensures values in a column meet a specific condition
#6.DEFAULT-Sets a default value for a column when none is provided


-- 3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.

#ans- Not null Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL (empty) value. No primary key not containing NULL values because
#     A primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table and ensuring that a column cannot have a Null Vlaue, it must meet two main criteria.


-- 4.Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an 
#example for both adding and removing a constraint.

-- adding constraint
alter table employees
add constraint unique_email unique(email);

-- removing constraint
alter table employees
drop constraint unique_email;

-- 5. Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints. 
# Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.
# Ans.
-- insert violates
insert into Employees(emp_id, emp_name) values (1,NULL)
#In this case, if the name column is defined as NOT NULL, it will violates constraints not null.

# insert into Employees (emp_id, email) VALUES (2, 'john@example.com');
# insert into Employees (emp_id, email) VALUES (3, 'john@example.com');
#If the email column is defined as UNIQUE, the second insert will fail because the email 'john@example.com' already exists.

-- update violates

update employees
set age = 15
where emp_id = 1;
#In this scenario check constraint violates due age is under 18.

-- delete violates

delete from employees
where emp_id = 1;
#Deleting records that are linked to other tables may fail due to FOREIGN KEY constraints, preventing orphaned data.


-- 6.You created a products table without constraints as follows:
 CREATE TABLE products (
 product_id INT,
 product_name VARCHAR(50),
 price DECIMAL(10, 2));
 
 # Now, you realise that
 # The product_id should be a primary key
 # The price should have a default value of 50.00
 
 -- ANS.
 
 alter table products
 add constraint product_id primary key (product_id);
 
 alter table products
 alter column price 
 set default 50.00;
 
 
 -- 7.You have two tables:
 
 
 
 -- 8.
 
 
 
 -- 9. Given the following tables:
-- sales(sale_id,product_id, amount), 
-- products(product_id, product_name)
 
 # Write a query to find the total sales amount for each product using an INNER JOIN and the SUM() function.
 -- ANS>
 select p.product_name, sum(s.amount) as Total sales
 from products as p
 inner join sales as s
 on p.product_id = s.product_id
 group by p.product_name;
 
 -- 10.You are given three tables:
 -- orders(order_id, order_date, customer_id),
 -- customers(customer_id, customer_name)
 -- order_details(order_id, product_id, quantity)
 
 #  Write a query to display the order_id, customer_name, and the quantity of products ordered by each 
# customer using an INNER JOIN between all three tables.

 -- ANS-
 select o.order_id, c.customer_name, od.quantity
 from orders as o
 inner join customers c on o.customer_name =c.customer_name
 inner join order_details od on o.order_id = od.order_id;

###   Normalisation & CTE   ###

#1. First Normal Form (1NF):
			# a. Identify a table in the Sakila database that violates 1NF. Explain how you
			# would normalize it to achieve 1NF
            
-- Ans- In the Sakila database, a table that might violate First Normal Form (1NF) is the address table if it
#  hypothetically contained multiple values in a single field. For instance, if the address field had
# multiple addresses listed in a single row, it would violate 1NF.which requires each column to contain only
# atomic (indivisible) values.



#2.. Second Normal Form (2NF):
   -- a. Choose a table in Sakila and describe how you would determine whether it is in 2NF. 
		# If it violates 2NF, explain the steps to normalize it.
        
        
	-- Ans-The rental table has a single primary key, rental_id. Since there’s no composite primary key in this table,
          #  it inherently satisfies the 2NF requirement—there can’t be any partial dependencies if there’s only one attribute 
          #   in the primary key.
          
          -- steps to normalize
          #1.Identify Partial Dependencies
          #2.Separate into New Tables
          #3.Resulting Tables in 2NF
          
	#3. Third Normal Form (3NF):
    -- a. Identify a table in Sakila that violates 3NF. Describe the transitive dependencies 
         #      present and outline the steps to normalize the table to 3NF.
         
         
	-- Ans- In the Sakila database, the payment table could potentially violate Third Normal Form (3NF) due to a transitive dependency on non-key attributes.
          #payment table includes customer_name and staff_name columns. These columns lead to a transitive dependency on non-primary key attributes.
    
      #Steps to Normalize the payment Table to 3NF
-- 1.Identify Transitive Dependencies
-- 2.Separate Dependent Data
-- 3.Establish Foreign Key Relationships


#4. Normalization Process:
		-- a. Take a specific table in Sakila and guide through the process of normalizing it from the initial unnormalized form up to at least 2NF.
        
        -- ANS-unnormalized form-City and country information are duplicated and stored with each address.
        #STEPS--1.Step 1: Convert to First Normal Form (1NF)
        #2.Convert to Second Normal Form (2NF)
        #3.Step-by-Step Normalization to 2NF- Create a city Table,Create a country Table,Update the address Table
        
        #Summary of Normalization Changes
#1NF: Ensured atomic values and identified a primary key (address_id).
#2NF: Removed partial dependencies by creating separate city and country tables, reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.
